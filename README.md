# Output
**Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.**
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence designed to create new content such as text, images, music or even code by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI systems that primarily analyze or classify data, generative AI models like GPT (for text) or DALL·E (for images) can produce original outputs that mimic human creativity. These models use techniques like deep learning and neural networks to generate content that is coherent, contextually relevant and often indistinguishable from that created by humans.
Generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, uses sophisticated algorithms to organize large, complex data sets into meaningful clusters of information in order to create new content, including text, images and audio, in response to a query or prompt. GenAI typically does two things: First, it encodes a collection of existing information into a form (vector space) that maps data points based on the strength of their correlations (dependencies). Second, when prompted, it then generates (decodes) new content by finding the correct context within the existing dependencies in the vector space.

Familiar to users through popular interfaces such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, generative AI can answer complex questions, summarize vast amounts of information, and automate many tasks done previously by humans. For example, businesses use generative AI to help draft reports, personalize marketing campaigns, make commercial films and improve code. Software vendors are integrating generative AI into core business applications, such as CRM and ERP, to boost efficiency and improve decision-making. GenAI is also being added to existing automation software, such as robotic process automation (RPA) and customer service chatbots, to make them more proactive. Under the hood, generative AI is being used to create synthetic data to train other AI and machine learning models.
