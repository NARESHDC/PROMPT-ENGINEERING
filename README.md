# Output
**Explain the foundational concepts of Generative AI.**

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence designed to create new content such as text, images, music or even code by learning patterns from existing data. Unlike traditional AI systems that primarily analyze or classify data, generative AI models like GPT (for text) or DALL·E (for images) can produce original outputs that mimic human creativity. These models use techniques like deep learning and neural networks to generate content that is coherent, contextually relevant and often indistinguishable from that created by humans.
Generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, uses sophisticated algorithms to organize large, complex data sets into meaningful clusters of information in order to create new content, including text, images and audio, in response to a query or prompt. GenAI typically does two things: First, it encodes a collection of existing information into a form (vector space) that maps data points based on the strength of their correlations (dependencies). Second, when prompted, it then generates (decodes) new content by finding the correct context within the existing dependencies in the vector space.

Familiar to users through popular interfaces such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, generative AI can answer complex questions, summarize vast amounts of information, and automate many tasks done previously by humans. For example, businesses use generative AI to help draft reports, personalize marketing campaigns, make commercial films and improve code. Software vendors are integrating generative AI into core business applications, such as CRM and ERP, to boost efficiency and improve decision-making. GenAI is also being added to existing automation software, such as robotic process automation (RPA) and customer service chatbots, to make them more proactive. Under the hood, generative AI is being used to create synthetic data to train other AI and machine learning models.

**Focusing on Generative AI architectures. (like transformers).**

This long-form article explains how generative AI works, from the ground all the way up to generative transformer architectures. The focus is on intuitions, not rigor. A number of technical details are of course simplified. It is a gentle introduction, not a scientific article.

We are breaking it down to two parts: This first part explains how AI understands natural language. This includes embeddings, language models, transformer-encoders, self-attention, fine tuning for AI search and NLP. The second part will build on this to explain how AI uses this understanding to generate text such as responses to your natural language prompts and translations, including decoder-only and full transformer architectures, large language models (LLMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a prominent generative pattern at which Elastic excels. Because the language models we will discuss involve neural networks, a basic understanding of the neural networks fundamentals is assumed for certain parts in this journey.
Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers have outperformed the earlier Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in various tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, text summarization, etc.

Transformers achieve their unique capabilities from its architecture. This chapter will explain the main ideas of the original transformer model in simple terms to make it easier to understand.

Generative AI: Applications, Use Cases, and Examples
Generative AI is changing the world, reimagining processes, transforming experiences, and reengineering modern businesses on the edge of a fast-changing world. 

While traditional AI and machine learning systems identify patterns in data for insights, generative AI goes a step further by creating new data as its main output. Imagine, receiving a full speech text in seconds just by providing a few keywords, generating music, art, or images from text descriptions, or developing a business strategy through interactive conversations with back-and-forth “prompting” and more. 

In this article, we will delve into the meaning of generative AI, exploring the diverse generative AI business applications and use cases across industries. We will also explore how generative AI functions, review generative AI examples in real-world scenarios, and discuss the impact of generative AI on business outcomes.

**Generative AI impact of scaling in LLMs.**

Generative AI can learn from existing artifacts to generate new, realistic artifacts (at scale) that reflect the characteristics of the training data but don’t repeat it. It can produce a variety of novel content, such as images, video, music, speech, text, software code and product designs.  

Generative AI uses a number of techniques that continue to evolve. Foremost are AI foundation models, which are trained on a broad set of unlabeled data that can be used for different tasks, with additional fine-tuning. Complex math and enormous computing power are required to create these trained models, but they are, in essence, prediction algorithms. 

Today, generative AI most commonly creates content in response to natural language requests — it doesn’t require knowledge of or entering code — but the enterprise use cases are numerous and include innovations in drug and chip design and material science development. 
Almost all of the LLM based Generative AI models use the same deep learning architecture - the decoder model of transformer architecture propounded in “Attention is All you Need” paper. Whether it is GPT-4 or Tiny Llama, the underlying deep learning architecture is same.  To improve the performance of the LLM based Generative AI models, there could be several theoretical options available. Researchers found however that performance depends strongly on scale, weakly on model shape.   

Researchers found that using bigger models, with bigger datasets and training for longer duration led to significant performance benefits. More specifically, Model Size in terms of total number of parameters (N), Size of dataset in terms of number of tokens (D) and Compute used to train the model ( C) are the three factors that had major impact on the model performance. By scaling these three factors, model performance could be significantly improved.   The computing infrastructure refers to the computing budget measured by FLOPs (Floating Point Operations per Second). The FLOPS required for a model is roughly given by the product of number of parameters (N) and Size of Dataset (D) multiplied by 6. The dataset size is measured by the number of tokens / training tokens where training tokens is product of number of tokens and training steps.  

However, there are constraints to all these factors. Bigger model sizes have impact on inference budget. Huge models require bigger RAM for training and inference infrastructure. Increasing dataset size has its own limit - it is said that entire internet data would amount to only few trillion tokens. Compute budget is also limited, the GPU infrastructure is costly and scarce and once training starts it would be a wastage of resources, if the model does not converge to optimal performance. Give these natural constraints, it becomes important to understand the relationship between these parameters for optimal model performance.

# Result

This comprehensive report provides an overview of generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the foundational concepts, architecture intuition, practical implications of scaling, and references to canonical papers. Generative AI refers to models that produce new data by learning the distribution of a training dataset and sampling from it. These models either learn an explicit likelihood/latent representation and decode from it or learn to produce samples implicitly.

The report outlines main generative model families, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Diffusion models, Transformer-based autoregressive & seq2seq models (LLMs), and Transformer architecture. GANs produce sharp images and artistic outputs but are unstable to train and can suffer from mode collapse. VAEs learn an encoder to a latent distribution and a decoder that reconstructs samples from latents, optimizing a variational lower bound (ELBO). Diffusion models gradually add noise to data until it becomes (nearly) pure noise and reverse, yielding state-of-the-art image synthesis quality. Transformer architecture uses self-attention to model token dependencies without recurrence, making it the backbone of modern LLMs.

The report also discusses high-level components such as embedding & positional encoding, multi-Head Self-Attention layers, feedforward MLP sublayers, and stacking many layers to create deep contextual encoders/decoders.
